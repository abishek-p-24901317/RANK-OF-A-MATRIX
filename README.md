# RANK-OF-A-MATRIX
## Aim:
To write a python program to find the rank of a matrix
## Equipment’s required:
1. 	Hardware – PCs
2. 	Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner
## Algorithm:
## Step 1: Start by importing the NumPy library, which provides built-in functions for matrix operations.

## Step 2:Define or input the matrix for which the rank is to be calculated.

## Step 3:Use the function np.linalg.matrix_rank() from NumPy to compute the rank.

## Step 4:Store the result returned by the function in a variable.

## Step 5:Display the rank as the output to the user.
## Program:
```

import numpy as np
a=np.array([[5,-3,-10],[2,2,-3],[-3,-1,5]])
solution=np.linalg.matrix_rank(a)
print(solution)
```
## Output:
